# Pragati: Real-time Street Parking and Traffic Management System

## Overview

Pragati is an indigenous real-time street parking and traffic management system. Our solution utilizes state-of-the-art technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, and energy-efficient sensors to provide real-time traffic analysis and vital insights on available parking spaces. 

## Problem Statement

With the constantly increasing number of vehicles in India and the lack of adequate parking spaces, issues like traffic congestion, illegal parking, and a mismatch between parking supply and demand have become prevalent. Pragati aims to address these issues by providing a technology-driven solution to optimize the utilization of parking spaces, manage traffic effectively, and generate a sustainable revenue source for city administration.

## Features

1. **Real-time Parking Availability**: Pragati uses machine learning algorithms and sensor data to provide real-time updates on available parking spaces.

2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Our system optimizes parking prices based on demand to ensure effective resource usage and generate sustainable revenue.

3. **Parking Reservation and Payment**: Users can conveniently reserve parking spots and make payments through the app, saving time and reducing environmental impact.

4. **Traffic Management**: Pragati analyzes traffic patterns to help city administrators manage congestion and optimize mobility.

5. **Data Analysis**: Pragati collects and analyzes data on parking usage, traffic patterns, and pricing which can be used to make informed decisions and policy planning.

## Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow and PyTorch are used for predictive analysis and pattern recognition.
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV is used for real-time image and video analysis to detect vehicle presence.
- **IoT Sensors**: Energy-efficient sensors are used for real-time data collection on the availability of parking spaces.
- **Backend**: Python and Node.js handle server-side operations, processing sensor data, and running machine learning models.
- **Frontend**: Flutter is used to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Database**: Firebase is used to store real-time sensor data and user information. It allows for efficient data retrieval and real-time updates.
- **Cloud**: AWS provides scalable computing and storage resources, ensuring the system can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.
- **Blockchain**: Blockchain for recording transaction and data, payment processing and NFT/ Token based reward system.
